# Getting Started

Run the following command to create a new plainweb starter project:

```bash
npx create-plainweb
```

And follow the prompts to set up your project.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will start the development server at `http://localhost:3000`.

Head over to [Directory Structure](/docs/directory-structure) to learn about the starter.

## A solid foundation

plainweb is not a framework, so it won't abstract away tools and hide them from you. plainweb is mostly built on top of:

- [htmx](https://htmx.org/)
- [drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started-sqlite)
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first)
- [zod](https://zod.dev/)
- [express](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html)

It's a good idea to get familiar with them to make most of plainweb. Don't worry, you'll have the chance to dig into each of them later.
